Articles
========

This is the private repository that purpose is to contain both articles and examples for them. My hope is to update it regularly~~ish~~.

It is also definitely a my first attempt to use **markdown**.

```c#
[Test]
public void IsMyFirstTrySuccessful()
{
    Assert.IsTrue(you.CanSeeThis());
}
```
